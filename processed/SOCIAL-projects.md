## Social impact projects

Our specially curated immersive experiences offer our participants an opportunity to engage with the social sector and underserved communities through various internships and projects. This helps our participants understand the nuances of India and Bharat, develop social sensibilities and apply their management skills in unstructured environments.

PGPM participants engage with the local underprivileged community through **Abhyudaya** and work with social sector organisations across India through our **Development of Corporate Citizenship (DoCC)**. The objective is to help broaden our participants’ perspectives and nurture responsible leadership for enduring societal impact.

### Sonakshi Anand, PGPM Class of 2023

“This initiative wasn’t just about imparting knowledge; it was a two-way learning experience. I found myself learning as much from the Sitaras as they did from us. Their resilience, eagerness to learn, and determination despite the struggles they faced inspired me to tackle my challenges.”
