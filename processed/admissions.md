## PGPM admission process

PGPM admissions follow the rolling interview process. Outstanding candidates receive an offer letter even before the closing date of admissions. Rolling admissions and early offers facilitate smooth transition from a full-time job to a **full-time management programme**. PGPM seeks individuals with consistent academic records, relevant professional experience, versatile achievements and diverse interests who are determined to impact positive changes in their career graphs.

**Disclaimer:** Admission to the Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGPM) at S. P. Jain Institute of Management & Research (SPJIMR) is strictly based on merit. SPJIMR does not have any quota, management or otherwise. The assessment of an applicant is on the basis of his/her profile, the qualifying entrance scores and the interview process. SPJIMR communicates directly with all the shortlisted candidates, SPJIMR never appoints an intermediary (whether an individual or organisation) under any circumstance to approach any candidate with claims of confirmed admission, for a fee or otherwise. SPJIMR strongly recommends that you do not get involved in such transactions.

**Note:** As per the AICTE Notification (F.no. 1-101/PGRC/AICTE/Regulation/2019), all admission related grievances will be looked into by the institute’s Grievance Redressal Committee (grc@spjimr.org) and the Ombudsperson appointed as per this notification.
